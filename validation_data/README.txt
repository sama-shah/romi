About mcPHASES
This dataset aggregates data from multiple personal health tracking devices and surveys. Each CSV file corresponds to a specific type of measurement (e.g., Fitbit activity, glucose levels, hormone concentrations, self-reported symptoms).
All tables can be joined using the participant identifier and study day labels as keys.
* id: unique participant identifier
* day_in_study: normalized day index starting from Day 1 of each participant’s study interval


For time-spanning measurements (e.g., sleep), tables may include the following columns instead of day_in_study:
* sleep_start_day_in_study
* sleep_end_day_in_study
* start_day_in_study
* end_day_in_study


All tables also include two additional columns for temporally differentiating data:
* study_interval: whether data was collected from Interval 1 (January–April 2022) or Interval 2 (July–October 2024) of the study
* is_weekend: boolean indicator of whether the recorded day was a weekend
